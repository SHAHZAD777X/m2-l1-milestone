<h1>BEST TOURIST PLACES IN UAE</h1>

<h2>BURJ KHALIFA</h2>

<p></p>
The Burj Khalifa[a] (known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration) is a megatall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab
Emirates. Designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, it is the world's tallest structure, with a total height of 829.8 m
(2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding the antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire)[2] of 828
m (2,717 ft). It has also been the tallest building in the world since its topping out in 2009, surpassing Taipei 101,
which had held the record for a half-decade.[3][4]

Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004; the exterior was completed five years later. The primary structure is
reinforced concrete. Some of the structural steel for the building was salvaged from the demolished Palace of the
Republic in East Berlin.[5] The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was
designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development.

The building is named after the former president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al
Nahyan.[6] The United Arab Emirates government provided Dubai with financial support as the developer, Emaar Properties,
experienced financial problems during the Great Recession. Then-president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin
Zayed, organized federal financial support. For his support, Mohammad bin Rashid, Ruler of Dubai, changed the name from
"Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa" during inauguration.

The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped
tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimise residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are
used to support the height of the building. The Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation except
egress stairs within each of the wings.[7] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand
Dubai's hot summer temperatures.[8] It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.

<p>Ferrari World Abu Dhabi (Arabic: عالم فيراري أبوظبي) is a mostly indoors theme park located on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates. It is the world's first Ferrari-themed park and is the home of Formula Rossa, which has held the
record for the world’s fastest roller coaster since 2010. [1]

The foundation stone for the park was laid on 3 November 2007. Developed by Aldar Properties and constructed by BESIX
Group subsidiary Six Construct,[2] it took three years to develop the park until it was officially opened to the public
on 4 November 2010.[3] Ferrari World is part of the larger Yas Island entertainment complex, which includes other
attractions like Yas Waterworld, Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi, and the Yas Marina Circuit.

The most recent roller coaster to open is Mission Ferrari, which opened to the public in January 2023.[4]</p>
